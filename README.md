# NAIL Trivia: A web application created using a 3rd-party API and React.

We have created a trivia game that allows you to create an account and test your knowledge across multiple categories. You are allowed to pick the level of difficulty of the questions you are asked in each quiz, which are 10 questions each. Your score at the end of each game is stored, and each quiz you take adds to the total amount of points you have accrued since the creation of your account. Hard questions are 3 points each, medium quesitons are 2 points each, and easy questions are 1 point each. 

If you logout, and log back in with the same username and password, your total points are saved and stored in the profile tab. You can also delete your account, wiping away your username, password, and total points from the database.
